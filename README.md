# 💬 Random Quote Generator

A retro-style random quote machine built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Inspired by vintage fortune-telling machines, it displays short phrases across different categories — motivational, curious, inspiring, sarcastic, and popular.

Each quote can be copied to the clipboard, and your history and last selected category are saved automatically with `localStorage`.
